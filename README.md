# AEM CRXDE Lite – Hyper Dark Pro

A simple dark theme extension for AEM CRXDE Lite and Package Manager.

I built this because the default CRXDE UI felt outdated and hard on the eyes during long coding sessions. This extension improves the look and readability without modifying anything inside AEM itself.

## ✨ Features

- Dark mode for CRXDE Lite
- Dark mode for AEM Package Manager
- Improved typography (Inter + JetBrains Mono)
- Better code contrast
- Lightweight (CSS + small helper JS)
- No changes to AEM backend
